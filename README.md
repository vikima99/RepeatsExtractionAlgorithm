# Repeats_files
This project entitled as "A method to locate Identical Sequence Repeats across Multiple Protein sequences" .
We have developed a method based on Rabin-Karp algorithm to extract repeats across multiple protein sequences.
IRSMPS.py file is the algorithm developed.

Using developed method we have created many case studies to extract repeats in many protein sequences of fatal deseases such as Malaria, TB, Breast Cancer, Ovarian cancer and human organs protein sequences.
